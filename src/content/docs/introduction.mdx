Pycord is a modern, easy to use, feature-rich, and async ready API wrapper for Discord, written in Python. Pycord is a maintained fork of [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).

## Before you begin

Pycord is an advanced and complex Python library. To take advantage of the full capabilities of Pycord, you will need to have a good understanding of Python. You should know the basics of Python and have an understanding of the following concepts:

- Variables
- Data Types
- Functions
- Packages
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Classes
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Inheritance
- Exception Handling
- Iterators
- Coroutines
- Async/Await

This list is not exhaustive, but it should give you a good idea of what you need to know to get started.

When you see an ellipsis - that's the three dots - in this guide, it is a placeholder for code that you need to fill in. Sometimes, it may be code for a command, while other times it could be something simple like a Guild ID. Make sure to replace them before running your bot!

## Credits

First of all, we would like to thank [Rapptz](https://github.com/Rapptz) for the original [discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py) library. Pycord is a maintained fork of this library.

We would also like to thank the [discord.js guide](https://discordjs.guide), which inspired this guide style-wise, and the now defunct [first Pycord Guide](https://web.archive.org/web/20220813041929/https://namantech.me/pycord/) and [second Pycord Guide](https://web.archive.org/web/20250901002123/https://guide.pycord.dev/), which inspired some content and structure of this guide.

We created this guide using [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/), a modern documentation site generator for Astro. We would also like to thank the Widgetbot team for their [`@widgetbot/message-renderer`](https://github.com/widgetbot-io/message-renderer) package, that we use to render Discord messages throughout the guide.

And finally, we would like to thank the amazing and loving community of Pycord users, contributors and developers.
